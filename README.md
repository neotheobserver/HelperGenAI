# HelperGenAI

Flutter based app that uses gemini api to aid people through description of images.

## Getting Started

### Option 1 (Easiest)

Download the apk from the release section. Only android users are able to do this.

Apple users must follow Option 2 and also they might have to add certain permissions and stuff. I have not done anything specific for iphone but flutter being flutter it should not be hard to get it running on apple devices as well.

### Option 2

Download the source code and build by self

This option requires flutter sdk and android studio installed on the system to build.

After Setting up everything run

1. `git clone https://github.com/neotheobserver/HelperGenAI.git`

2. `cd HelperGenAi`

3. `flutter pub get`

4. Either `flutter run` or `flutter build`
